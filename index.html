    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    <p>
        Dear Eileen,
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part<br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>
        We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if youz<br> 
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
    </p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall<br> 
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just<br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority:
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the<br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect<br>
        the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:  
    </p>
    <p>
        Polynesian chicken dance
        <blockquote>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around</br> 
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.
        </blockquote>
        Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <blockquote>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br> 
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in impcrccptably<br>
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
            modem styles such as Twerking.
        </blockquote>
        Arctic robot dance
        <blockquote>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
            because they were really cold.

    <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
